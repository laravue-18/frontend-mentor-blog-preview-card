## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to apply responsive design using media queries and followed a mobile-first approach.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .card__title-label {
    // style here
  }
}
```
I learned about css class naming conventions using BEM (Block Element Modifier), which helped organize the styles more effectively.

### Continued development

I plan to explore more advanced responsive layout techniques and improve accessibility practices in future projects.
### Useful resources

- https://getbem.com/naming/ - This helped me for class naming. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
